# AspectJ Concepts

## Aspect
An aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes.

## Join Point
A Joinpoint is a point during the execution of a program, such as execution of 
a method or the handling of an exception.

## Point Cut
A Pointcut is a predicate that helps match an Advice to be applied by an Aspect at a particular JoinPoint.

## Advice
An advice is an action taken by an aspect at a particular Joinpoint. 
Different types of advice include “around,” “before” and “after” advice.
